# Deep_RL_Quadcopter_Controller
A deep Reinforcement Learning Project to teach quadcopter to fly

In this project, I have designed an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then trained it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of my choice!

Project Instructions
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
git clone https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter-2.git
cd RL-Quadcopter-2
Create and activate a new environment.
conda create -n quadcop python=3.6 matplotlib numpy pandas
source activate quadcop
Create an IPython kernel for the quadcop environment.
python -m ipykernel install --user --name quadcop --display-name "quadcop"
Open the notebook.
jupyter notebook Quadcopter_Project.ipynb
Before running code, change the kernel to match the quadcop environment by using the drop-down menu (Kernel > Change kernel > quadcop). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

You may likely need to install more pip packages to complete this project.
